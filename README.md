# TriviaTrek Adventure (Minimal Create-React-App scaffold)

This is a minimal React project scaffold for the TriviaTrek Adventure app.
It includes:
- Home page with category cards
- Per-category playground with clickable level markers on a map image
- MCQ card with hint support
- Sample JSON question data (1-2 questions per category)
- LocalStorage-based progress saving

To run:
1. npm install
2. npm start

Note: This repo uses react-scripts (Create React App). Replace the sample map image with your own for each category in src/assets/maps/.
